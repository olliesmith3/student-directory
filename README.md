### Notes ###

During the first attempt of this project I diverted from the task instructions by adding student
age instead of the variables given to me. It was only when getting to further exercises that I 
realised they relied on me completeing the earlier exercises as per the instructions. This is 
the reason for the revert at commit efb7ac4.
